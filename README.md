An Autocomplete Trie:

The purpose of this project was to explore the Abstract Data Type of a Trie. We wanted to create an application that could try and predict the next character of a string.

This project created a trie with every word in the English dictionary. We also created a GUI which shows the next likely character. These combined create an interactive user interface to show live predictions on what the next letter could be. This project used Visual Studio Code, JAVAFX, and an online dictionary for creating the trie. One of the challenges we faced was using JavaFX in an interesting way. We were able to adjust it to our satisfaction after sometime.

To use this program you need to make sure to have JavaFX downloaded. Once that has happened, you can download the files. To run the program, you compile the startingPoint.java and start typing away. As you type into the box you should see live updates on the next potential. Additionally, the testTrie.java has many assert statements to show how the program is working in different ways. To run that code, just hit run and compile. The code is relatively simple to understand. The program is easy to run and make work.
